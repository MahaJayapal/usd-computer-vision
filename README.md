# Computer Vision Project

This repository is dedicated to a computer vision project as part of the Applied AI Masterâ€™s program. It contains foundational models, datasets, and code to explore key computer vision concepts, focusing on tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The project aims to implement and experiment with state-of-the-art techniques to solve real-world vision problems, while providing a collaborative space for team members to develop, evaluate, and enhance computer vision solutions.

## Project Highlights

- **Implementations of essential computer vision algorithms and models**
- **Datasets and tools for training, validation, and testing**
- **Code for preprocessing, data augmentation, and model evaluation**
- **Collaborative workflows and documentation for learning and experimentation**

This repository serves as a high-level framework for building and applying computer vision models in practical AI applications.
